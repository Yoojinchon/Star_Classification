# Star Classification Project

## Project Overview

This project focuses on classifying stars into various types based on their properties. By analyzing a dataset of star attributes, such as temperature, luminosity, radius, and color, we developed a predictive model to categorize stars into their respective classes. This project applies data science techniques to explore and understand stellar classification, providing insights into astrophysical properties and aiding future astronomical research.

## Dataset

The dataset contains information on multiple star attributes, including:
- **Temperature**
- **Luminosity**
- **Radius**
- **Absolute magnitude**
- **Color**
- **Spectral class**

Each record corresponds to a star, with labeled types that serve as the target variable for classification.

## Goals

The primary goal of this project is to:
- Accurately classify stars into their types based on their attributes.
- Understand the correlation between star properties and classifications.
- Build a machine learning model that can predict star types for new, unseen data.

## Methodology

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Cleaning missing values, normalizing data, and encoding categorical features.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing relationships between features to gain insights.
3. **Model Selection**: Testing multiple classification models, including Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Random Forest.
4. **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. **Feature Importance Analysis**: Identifying the most influential features in predicting star types.

## Results

The final model achieved an accuracy of approximately XX%, with the following highlights:
- Top features contributing to classification accuracy.
- Confusion matrix analysis for each star type.
- Comparative performance metrics across different models.
